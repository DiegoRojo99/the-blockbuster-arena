# Categories Game Setup & Usage

## üéØ Overview

The Categories Game is a movie trivia game where players must group 16 movies into 4 categories of 4 movies each. It's like a movie-themed version of the popular connections puzzle game.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Database Setup

The categories game requires additional database tables. Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. **Categories Game Schema**: `sql/02_categories_game_schema.sql`
2. **Sample Data** (optional): `sql/03_categories_game_data.sql`

### Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` file has:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
```

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Navigate to the game**: Visit `/category-game` or click "Categories Game" from the home page
2. **Game loads automatically**: A random game template loads with 16 movies in a 4√ó4 grid
3. **Select 4 movies**: Click on movies you think belong to the same category
4. **Submit your guess**: Click "Submit Group" when you have exactly 4 movies selected
5. **Get feedback**: 
   - ‚úÖ **Correct**: The category is revealed and those movies are removed
   - ‚ùå **Incorrect**: You lose one attempt (default: 4 attempts total)
6. **Win condition**: Find all 4 categories before running out of attempts

- Check Supabase table permissions
- Verify all database tables exist and have correct structure

## üìù Development Notes

The game automatically falls back to static sample data if database games aren't available, ensuring it works even without full database setup. The admin interface allows creating new games with TMDB integration for rich movie metadata.
